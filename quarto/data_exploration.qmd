## Company Metadata

The company metadata provides general information about the company. This includes details such as the company name, fiscal year end date, and other essential information.

```{r explore_metadata_book, eval=TRUE}
# Assuming you have successfully retrieved company_Data
company_Metadata <- company_Data$company_Metadata
