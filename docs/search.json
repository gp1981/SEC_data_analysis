    "text": "In this section, we delve into the structure of the SEC data obtained from the API. The data follows a structured format in compliance with SEC reporting standards, utilizing XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language). XBRL is a standardized language designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting.\n\n\nXBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language): XBRL is a structured, machine-readable format ensuring consistency and comparability across companies and filings. As specialized language for business and financial data, XBRL enables standardized communication and presentation of financial information. It uses XML (eXtensible Markup Language) to tag financial data with labels that provide context and meaning. This tagging allows for easier analysis, comparability, and extraction of data by both humans and machines.\n\n\n\nConsistency: XBRL ensures consistency in financial reporting by providing a standardized set of tags for financial concepts, making it easier to compare data across different companies and periods.\nEfficiency: The use of XBRL streamlines the process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial information, reducing the need for manual data entry and interpretation.\nTransparency: XBRL enhances the transparency of financial data, as each financial concept is tagged with a specific label, providing clear identification and context.\n\n\n\n\nWithin the SEC data retrieved through the API, XBRL is utilized to structure financial information. .\nA basic understanding XBRL1 is necessary for navigating and interpreting the structured financial data retrieved from the SEC. It ensures a standardized approach to financial reporting, facilitating meaningful analysis and comparison.\nFirst, we load the required libraries and files.\n\n\nCode\nsource(\"setup.qmd\")          \n\n\nNow, let’s retrieve the necessary objects for data exploration:\n\n\nCode\n# Load company_data\ncompany_data &lt;- readRDS(\"company_data.RDS\")\ncik &lt;- readRDS(\"cik.RDS\")\n\n\nThe data retrieved from the SEC API is structured financial data compliant with SEC reporting standards.\nTo navigate through this structure for analysis, consider the following key elements:\n\ncik: The Central Index Key (CIK) is a unique identifier assigned to each company filing reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nentityName: This is the name of the company, in our case “JAKKS Pacific, Inc.”\nfacts: The main container for financial data, housing two critical sections:\n\ndei: Contains Document and Entity Information (DEI), providing basic company details.\nus-gaap: Holds financial data following the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\n\n\nWithin these sections, financial data is organized as a list of items, each with specific attributes:\n\nConcept: Represents a financial measure or item (e.g., “Assets”) with an associated label and data type.\nFacts: Actual numerical values associated with the concept, with attributes like “value,” “unitRef,” and “contextRef.”\nAttributes: Additional attributes providing context for the data, such as reporting period, currency unit, or data precision.\n\nEffectively analyzing this data involves selecting relevant concepts and Fact, potentially transforming or pivoting the data for further processing and visualization.\n\n\n\nLet’s start by exploring the structure of company_data:\n\n\nCode\n# Visualize structure of the company_data \nstr(company_data, max.level = 1) \n\n\nList of 3\n $ company_Metadata:List of 22\n $ company_Facts   :List of 3\n $ company_Concept :List of 7\n\n\nThe output reveals that company_data structure comprises three lists with nested lists, such as company_Metadata with 22 lists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn R, a list is a powerful data structure that can hold elements of different data types. This flexibility allows each element to be unique and cater to specific data requirements. For the company_data object, the list structure plays a crucial role in organizing various pieces of information, including financial data, company descriptions, and filing details. This heterogeneous nature of the data necessitates a flexible data structure like a list to accommodate these diverse data types. Understanding the organization and structure of the company_data list is essential for effective navigation and extraction of specific information. By grasping the relationships between the list elements, users can efficiently retrieve the desired data elements for analysis and interpretation.\n\n\n\n\nTo access the lists we use the symbol $ in after the object e.g. company_data$company_Metadata.\nNext, we split the company_data into separate lists: company_Metadata, company_Facts, company_Concept.\n\n\nCode\n# Split the lists in company_data\ncompany_Metadata &lt;- company_data$company_Metadata\ncompany_Facts &lt;- company_data$company_Facts\ncompany_Concept &lt;- company_data$company_Concept\n\n\nNow, let’s examine the structures and content of these lists:\n\n\nLet’s start with company_Metadata which includes 22 elements: characters, integer, sub-list (or nested list), etc.\n\n\nCode\n# Visualize structure of the company_Metadata\nstr(company_Metadata, max.level = 1)\n\n\nList of 22\n $ cik                              : chr \"1009829\"\n $ entityType                       : chr \"operating\"\n $ sic                              : chr \"3944\"\n $ sicDescription                   : chr \"Games, Toys & Children's Vehicles (No Dolls & Bicycles)\"\n $ insiderTransactionForOwnerExists : int 0\n $ insiderTransactionForIssuerExists: int 1\n $ name                             : chr \"JAKKS PACIFIC INC\"\n $ tickers                          : chr [1:2] \"JAKK\" \"JAKP\"\n $ exchanges                        : chr [1:2] \"Nasdaq\" \"OTC\"\n $ ein                              : chr \"954527222\"\n $ description                      : chr \"\"\n $ website                          : chr \"\"\n $ investorWebsite                  : chr \"\"\n $ category                         : chr \"Non-accelerated filer&lt;br&gt;Smaller reporting company\"\n $ fiscalYearEnd                    : chr \"1231\"\n $ stateOfIncorporation             : chr \"DE\"\n $ stateOfIncorporationDescription  : chr \"DE\"\n $ addresses                        :List of 2\n $ phone                            : chr \"424-268-9444\"\n $ flags                            : chr \"\"\n $ formerNames                      : list()\n $ filings                          :List of 2\n\n\nFor our purpose, the most relevant information of company_Metadata are:\n\ncik, as described above.\nsic, standard industrial classification.

In the United States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) establishes generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which provide guidelines for the preparation of financial statements, including the standardization of labels and concepts.\nDifferent companies may use different reporting styles to indicate Facts in different ways. The use of different labels however affect our ability to efficiently retrieve the appropriate financial data.\nThe objective here is to generate standardized financial reports of Balance sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow that so that we can use the same label to perform specific calculation across all companies.\nLet’s create now a dataframe including the data retrieved from company_Facts$facts$`us-gaap`.\n\n\nThe first step is un-nest the dataset, in particular the financial data, in company_Facts, nested in various sub-lists.\nThe following code can be used to un-nest the list within company_Facts and create a dataframe easy to visualize and useful for our purpose1.\n\n\nCode\ndf_Facts &lt;- Fundamentals_to_Dataframe(company_data)\n\n# Select the columns to print out and present the output with wrapped text and formatted numbers\ndf_Facts %&gt;% select(-c(description,accn)) %&gt;% \n  head() %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% \n  kable(\"html\") %&gt;% \n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nend\nval\nfy\nfp\nform\nfiled\nframe\nlabel\nus_gaap_reference\nstart\ncik\nentityName\nsic\nsicDescription\ntickers\n\n\n\n\n2010-12-31\n35.886\n2011\nQ2\n10-Q\n2011-08-01\nNA\nAccounts Payable, Current\nAccountsPayableCurrent\nNA\n0001009829\nJAKKS Pacific, Inc.\n3944\nGames, Toys & Children's Vehicles (No Dolls & Bicycles)\nJAKK\n\n\n2010-12-31\n35.886\n2011\nQ3\n10-Q\n2011-11-09\nNA\nAccounts Payable, Current\nAccountsPayableCurrent\nNA\n0001009829\nJAKKS Pacific, Inc.\n3944\nGames, Toys & Children's Vehicles (No Dolls & Bicycles)\nJAKK\n\n\n2010-12-31\n35.886\n2011\nFY\n10-K\n2012-03-15\nCY2010Q4I\nAccounts Payable, Current\nAccountsPayableCurrent\nNA\n0001009829\nJAKKS Pacific, Inc.\n3944\nGames, Toys & Children's Vehicles (No Dolls & Bicycles)\nJAKK\n\n\n2011-06-30\n51.537\n2011\nQ2\n10-Q\n2011-08-01\nCY2011Q2I\nAccounts Payable, Current\nAccountsPayableCurrent\nNA\n0001009829\nJAKKS Pacific, Inc.\n3944\nGames, Toys & Children's Vehicles (No Dolls & Bicycles)\nJAKK\n\n\n2011-09-30\n85.352\n2011\nQ3\n10-Q\n2011-11-09\nCY2011Q3I\nAccounts Payable, Current\nAccountsPayableCurrent\nNA\n0001009829\nJAKKS Pacific, Inc.\n3944\nGames, Toys & Children's Vehicles (No Dolls & Bicycles)\nJAKK\n\n\n2011-12-31\n26.430\n2011\nFY\n10-K\n2012-03-15\nNA\nAccounts Payable, Current\nAccountsPayableCurrent\nNA\n0001009829\nJAKKS Pacific, Inc.\n3944\nGames, Toys & Children's Vehicles (No Dolls & Bicycles)\nJAKK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that df_Facts$val is expressed in million.\nThe data in this dataframe is organized to facilitate analysis and comparison of financial information over different periods. Each row corresponds to a specific financial Concept (e.g. Accounts Payable) reported by the company, and the columns provide details about the reporting period, values, and other relevant attributes.\nTo recreate a financial statement from the data in df_Facts of JAKKS Pacific Inc., we need to extract the values in df_Fact$val of the various Concepts and corresponding date in df_Fact$end.\ndf_Fact has a long list of Concepts for multiple fiscal periods. The following code shows the large number of Concepts included in df_Fact, related to all financial reports.\n\n\nCode\n# Print the size in human-readable format\ncat(\"df_Facts includes:\", format(nrow(df_Facts), units = \"auto\"), \"records \\n\")\n\n\ndf_Facts includes: 15339 records \n\n\nFrom an extract of the df_Facts above, we would see repeated Concepts.

However, there are instances where a filing (e.g., 10-K) for a specific fiscal period (fy and fp) includes a comparison with previous fiscal periods. In these cases, the financial data may actually refer to a different period, as indicated by df_Facts$end, rather than the period specified by fy and fp.\nTo handle this scenario, we construct a dataframe of financial data based on the end date (df_Facts$end) of the reporting period and remove the remaining attributes such as fy, fp, etc. This ensures that we focus on the actual reporting period for the financial data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code will generate a standardized Balance Sheet (df_std_BS) based on a matching table in Excel (standardized_balancehseet.xlsx).
